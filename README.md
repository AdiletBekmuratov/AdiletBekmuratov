## Hi there! 👋

I'm a passionate React/React Native developer with experience building engaging and responsive web and mobile apps. I specialize in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks like React and React Native.

In addition to my expertise in these areas, I also have knowledge of other tools and technologies such as:

- ⚡ **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) apps.
- ⛓️ **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
- 💨 **Node.js**: A runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of your browser.
- 😺 **Nest.js**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable server-side applications.

I'm committed to writing clean, maintainable code that adheres to industry best practices and standards. I enjoy collaborating with others, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to expand my skill set and learn from other developers.
